### Key Features

**üèóÔ∏è Multi-Context Architecture**

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "OgPgy Bank System"
        subgraph "Account Context"
            AS[Account Service]
            AR[Account Repository]
        end
        
        subgraph "Payment Context"
            PS[Payment Service]
            PR[Payment Repository]
        end
        
        subgraph "Compliance Context"
            CS[Compliance Service]
            CR[Compliance Repository]
        end
        
        AS --> PR
        PS --> AR
        CS --> AR
        CS --> PR
    end
```

*Isolated contexts that can import and export components across domain boundaries.*

=== "‚ö° Declarative Components"

    ```python
    from opusgenie_di import og_component, BaseComponent, ComponentScope
    
    @og_component(scope=ComponentScope.SINGLETON)
    class AccountService(BaseComponent):
        def __init__(self, account_repo: AccountRepository):
            super().__init__()
            self.account_repo = account_repo
        
        async def create_account(self, customer_id: str) -> Account:
            # Business logic here
            return await self.account_repo.save(account)
    ```
    
    Simple decorators that make components injectable and manageable.

=== "üîÑ Async Lifecycle Management"

    ```python
    async def initialize(self) -> None:
        """Called when component starts up"""
        await self.connect_to_database()
        logger.info("Account service initialized")
    
    async def cleanup(self) -> None:
        """Called when component shuts down"""
        await self.close_connections()
        logger.info("Account service cleaned up")
    ```
    
    Built-in async lifecycle hooks for proper resource management.

=== "üéØ Type Safety"

    ```python
    from typing import Protocol
    
    class PaymentProcessor(Protocol):
        async def process(self, payment: Payment) -> PaymentResult: ...
    
    @og_component()
    class VelocityPayProcessor(BaseComponent):
        async def process(self, payment: Payment) -> PaymentResult:
            # Implementation
            pass
    ```
    
    Full type safety with Python protocols and type hints.

## Why OgPgy Bank Chose OpusGenie DI

### The Challenge

Elena Korvas faced a common problem in financial technology: **How do you build a banking system that's both secure and agile?** Traditional monolithic approaches were too rigid, but microservices without proper dependency management led to coupling nightmares.

### The Solution

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph "Before: Monolithic Coupling"
        M1[Account Module] --> M2[Payment Module]
        M2 --> M3[Compliance Module]
        M3 --> M1
        M1 --> M4[Reporting Module]
        M2 --> M4
        M3 --> M4
    end
    
    subgraph "After: Context-Based Architecture"
        subgraph "Account Context"
            AC[Account Components]
        end
        subgraph "Payment Context"
            PC[Payment Components]
        end
        subgraph "Compliance Context"
            CC[Compliance Components]
        end
        subgraph "Reporting Context"
            RC[Reporting Components]
        end
        
        AC -.->|imports| PC
        PC -.->|imports| CC
        RC -.->|imports| AC
        RC -.->|imports| PC
        RC -.->|imports| CC
    end
```

OpusGenie DI enabled OgPgy Bank to:

- **Isolate business domains** in separate contexts
- **Share components** across contexts when needed
- **Test each domain** independently
- **Scale teams** around business capabilities
- **Deploy services** independently

## Real-World Impact

!!! success "OgPgy Bank Results"
    
    - **99.99% uptime** for core banking operations
    - **Sub-second response times** for 95% of API calls
    - **Zero data breaches** since implementing proper context isolation
    - **50% faster development** cycles with independent team deployments
    - **Regulatory compliance** maintained across all contexts

## Customer Stories

### Maria Santos - Freelance Graphic Designer

*"I need my banking to be as creative and flexible as my work. OgPgy's instant mobile transfers let me get paid by clients and pay suppliers without missing a beat."*

**How OpusGenie DI helps:** The payment processing context handles real-time transfers while maintaining strict isolation from account management, ensuring security without sacrificing speed.

### David Kim - Small Business Owner

*"Running a restaurant chain means dealing with complex financial flows. OgPgy's SME lending platform understood my business from day one."*

## Architecture Philosophy

OpusGenie DI follows the principle of **"Dependency Injection as Code"** - your architecture should be as explicit and declarative as your business logic. Every component, every dependency, and every context boundary is clearly defined in code, making your system both powerful and understandable.

Whether you're building a simple web application or a complex financial system like OgPgy Bank, OpusGenie DI provides the foundation for clean, maintainable, and scalable Python applications.
